# python-first-program


## GUI Program
gui_program is using a Virtual_env to install libraries : 

## first website
pip install flask didn't work (dependencies on C++ Redistributables if I remember well, that would take Gigabytes of disk space and hours to install)
I worked around that with Docker Desktop. Nice surprise here as following a few tutorial I ended up with a working image and efficient work environment.
 BUT Visual Studio gives me error due to the absence of Flask on my Windows System ... Might be cool to use the WSL to work on that in the future. ! Do not checkout on the same folder to avoir EOL problems.
